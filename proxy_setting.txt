Proxy

A proxy is a piece of software that is installed on a server.

Within Simplyhealth we have a proxy server, which is the server that has the proxy software installed.

All users on the netwrok will access the internet by going through this proxy server.

This means the proxy can control what websites can be accessed and seen.

The proxy can identify a user so it can give access to certain websites, based on the user or the groups the user is a part of.

The internet browsers you use are intelligent enough to pick up the details of the network proxy you are using.

You can see these details by going into Internet Explorer and:
	1. Go to Internet Options
	2. Select the Connections tab
	3. Select LAN Settings
You will see the Proxy server settings, the values are protected but you can see them if you need them for
